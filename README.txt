Python Bot Package Installer
By: Matthew's Development

Version: 2.0

This is a setup batch script that allows you to install packages easily to make bots.
Supports package installing for Discord bots, Guilded bots, and Revolt bots.
If you plan to self-host your discord bots, guilded bots, and/or revolt bots, this tool will be helpful to install packages really easily.

discordpyinstallers.bat is the old version of the software (Version 1.1)
pythonbotpackageinstaller.bat is the new version of the software
pythonbotpackageinstaller.sh is the shell version of this. It is extremely basic since I don't know much about this and idk how to convert from the .bat file.
- If you know how .sh files work, open a pull request or an issue.
